x canary

x imperative solution
x test imperative for position 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10
x test imperative for position -1

x functional solution:
x test functional for position 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10
x test functional for position -1

x recursive solution:
x test recursive for position 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10
x test recursive for position -1

x memoized solution:
x test memoized for position 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 10
x test memoized for position -1

x let's verify that a call to memoized takes 10x less time than a call to recursion
x let's write a test to verify that for a small value of position, like 3, the different in speed between the two versions is not much.
